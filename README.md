# Convert AsenjoPapers.html to publications.yml

This repo contains the files used to automatically parse AsenjoPapers.html and write the same information using the YML format. The result is the publications.yml file (after some manual edits) that is used in the [PPMC Web Site](https://github.com/PPMC-DAC/WebSite) published [here](https://www.ac.uma.es/~asenjo/research/index).

The main file is **bs-scrape.py** that is based on Beautiful Soup library. In this regard, some relevant information can be found in these links:
